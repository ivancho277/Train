# Train
A simple site that uses Firebase to store user inputted train times and keep them displayed on the screen, also adds each added one to the database and displays it.

* Learned how to create simple database with firebase and use it in a JS project
* Learned different ways to interact with created database after it is initialized, using .ref(), .push(), .on("value" or "child_append) and other methods and event handlers of firebase
* Experience with using javascipts moment library for time calculations and manipulations
* More experience with dynamically rendering html to the DOM with jquery and more DOM manipulation
